# Neural Networks Exercises

This repo contains simple and basic Neural Network exercises that I'm wrtiring to grasp its concepts better, my goal is to start from basic go deeper in time.

**Why I made This Repo?**  
beside the fact that I want to have my codes all stored, I made it public so anybody that is intested can read or clone it, I tried to write usefull comments to help other flow students.
